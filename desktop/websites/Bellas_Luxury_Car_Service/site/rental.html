<h1> We have a variety of cars for rent.</h1>
<h2>New Drivers
POLICIES
Rental Requirements

Renter must have the following documentation. A valid driverâ€™s license issued in New York,  A TLC license issued in New York. A Social Security card. A valid DDC (6 hour Defensive Drivers Class Certificate) and a proof of address. In order to obtain insurance.</h2>

<h2>Payment Methods

We accept cash, money orders, bank transfers or direct deposits. We will ask you to make the 1st weeks payment in advance, and then all subsequent payments at the beginning of your weekly rental period. Any security deposits will be returned 2 weeks from the end of your rental.</h2>

<h2>Insurance

We will provide you an auto insurance policy that meets TLC Vehicle Insurance Requirements. There is a $1000 deductible that the renter will be held responsible for if any damage is done to one of our vehicles during his or her rental period. </h2>

<h2>In Case of Accident

Please call 911, fill out the Accident Report at the time of the accident and thereafter you must get the Police Report as soon as its available for pickup. Call our Maintenance/Accident phone number which is on the emergency info page in your car. If our office is closed please leave message via voicemail or email and we will contact you shortly. </h2>

<h2>In the event of any accident involving another vehicle, there is always some follow up paper work needed from the renter (possibly several weeks after the accident). You must comply with our Fleet Manager requests for you to come in to our office and fill out any necessary paperwork and be available to do so in a timely fashion. Failure to do this will make you solely responsible and liable for any and all damages to any or all vehicles or property involved in the accident.</h2>

<h2>Returning A Vehicle

We require a minimum of 2 weeks notice in order to process your return or if you have a contract you must make sure to follow it. Returns can only be scheduled for days that our office is open (Monday-Friday). Vehicles must be returned to our office. All returns are scheduled for 930am-10am on the day of your return. Please make sure that your vehicle is clean and any damage done to the vehicle during your rental period or any mechanical problems you may have noticed must be reported to us (via email, bellasluxuryservice@gmail.com) at least 3 business days prior to you scheduled return.</h2>

<h2>Rental Rate

We consider our weekly rate as a 7 day rate.

No smoking! No pets! No one wants to sit in a car that has pet hair or odor in it. Please do not carry dogs or cats in the vehicle. If the vehicle returns with pet dirt or odor, you will be charged for detailing, cleaning and deodorizing the vehicle. The charge is a minimum $100, depending on the work necessary. This is a strict policy that will be enforced. Please be considerate of others and our vehicles.</h2>

<h2>Repairs

No repairs of any kind, no matter how large or small may be done to the rental vehicle without written approval of the management. If a repair is done without approval, the Renter will be fully responsible for any and all additional repair work that might be needed in order to properly repair the rental vehicle and to bring it backto its pre-rental condition. </h2>

<h2>Flat or Punctured Tires

All tire repairs and changes must be done by our service centers approved by Bellasluxuryservice. Wear and tear to tires is natural and Bellas luxury car service bears the cost of replacement tires that have low treads due to many hours of regular driving. (Our vehicles get new tires at least twice a year). We will not replace tires that have been damaged due to potholes, nails or any other kind of damage caused by a renter other than standard wear and tear.</h2>

<h2>Tolls and Tickets 

The renter is totally and solely responsible for all parking, traffic, TLC, E-Z PASS or any other type of ticket or violation during the time of the rental. If renter ignores any tickets or summonses received, after 7 days any outstanding tickets or summonses on the car will be paid by Bellas luxury car serice and a $40 administrative fee over and above the summons fee, plus any additional late fees or other service charges administered by NYC or any other municipality that issued the summons will be charged to the driver. This could cost you a lot more than the original ticket. So don't get a ticket. If you do, pay it timely in order to avoid other charges. There is no escape from paying summonses. Please take our advice.</h2>

<h2>TLC Rules

Our vehicles cannot be used for street hails. Bellas Luxury Car Service takes no responsibility to educate any renter in regards to the do's and don'ts of the TLC/DMV (or any other regulatory bodies) rules. It is the sole responsibility of the renter to know the laws and abide by them. </h2>
