<h2> Job Description</h2>
<p> Photography is not my job it's my passiom, from the moment that I arrived in the Big Apple, I knew that I wanted to be a part of this wonderful city. By becoming part of this wonderful city made me want to start my personal album. I felt to particpate and interact more with New Yorkers by sharing some of my pictures.</p>
